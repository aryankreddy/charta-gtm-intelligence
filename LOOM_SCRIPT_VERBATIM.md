# Charta GTM Intelligence Tool - Verbatim Loom Script
**Duration: 75-90 seconds | Read this word-for-word**

## THE SCRIPT (Read exactly as written)

*[0:00 - Dashboard visible]*

Hi, I'm [YOUR NAME], and I built this GTM Intelligence Tool for Charta Health.

Here's the problem I solved: healthcare has millions of potential customers, but who should sales call first?

*[0:08 - Pause briefly, let that sink in]*

This system answers that question using real data from CMS - the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

I ingested Medicare claims data, MIPS quality scores, HPSA designations, and NPPES provider records to score one-point-four million organizations nationwide.

*[0:22 - Hover over Info icon next to "Tier 1 Leads"]*

Every organization gets an ICP score from zero to one hundred based on three components.

Pain - forty points max - measuring revenue leakage from undercoding.

Strategic Fit - thirty points max - alignment with proven segments like FQHCs.

And Strategic Value - thirty points max - deal size potential.

*[0:38 - Point to tier tooltip showing]*

Organizations are tiered: Tier One is seventy-plus, high-priority leads. Tier Two is fifty to sixty-nine, qualified leads. Tier Three is below fifty, low priority.

*[0:47 - Click Tier 1 filter, then FQHC segment filter]*

The system applies different scoring logic for different practice types - Ambulatory versus Behavioral Health - and I can filter by tier, segment, or verified status.

*[0:57 - Click on top FQHC lead like "Grace Health, Inc." - drawer opens]*

Let's look at a real example. Grace Health scored eighty-nine out of one hundred.

*[1:02 - Point to Strategic Brief at top]*

The Strategic Intelligence Brief instantly shows me: estimated revenue lift of [READ THE ACTUAL NUMBER] dollars - and notice it says VERIFIED, meaning this is calculated from actual Medicare claims, not projected.

*[1:14 - Scroll to Score Breakdown section]*

The score is fully explainable. Pain: [READ ACTUAL NUMBER] out of forty points, measured via undercoding ratio from CMS data.

Fit: [READ ACTUAL NUMBER] out of thirty, FQHC designation plus MIPS and HPSA indicators.

Strategy: [READ ACTUAL NUMBER] out of thirty, based on patient volume and revenue scale.

*[1:28 - Hover over Pain bar to show tooltip]*

Hover over any component to see the exact reasoning - this is data-driven, not guesswork.

*[1:33 - Scroll down quickly to show contact info, then click Export button]*

The database includes contact info, network details, key metrics, buying signals - and I can export directly to HubSpot or CSV for immediate sales follow-up.

*[1:43 - Close drawer, back to filtered Tier 1 table]*

Bottom line: this tool transforms GTM from spray-and-pray to surgical precision.

Instead of manually researching thousands of clinics, sales now has [READ TIER 1 COUNT] high-priority leads with verified revenue opportunities, data-driven prioritization, and explainable intelligence - a multi-million dollar pipeline ready for immediate outreach.

*[1:58 - Smile, confident pause]*

Thanks for watching.

## BEFORE YOU START

### Fill in these blanks from your actual dashboard:

1. **Your name**: _________________
2. **Grace Health score** (or whichever lead you pick): _____/100
3. **Grace Health revenue lift**: $______K
4. **Grace Health Pain score**: _____/40
5. **Grace Health Fit score**: _____/30
6. **Grace Health Strategy score**: _____/30
7. **Total Tier 1 count**: _____ leads

### Practice saying these numbers naturally:
- "one-point-four million" (not "1.4")
- "eighty-nine out of one hundred" (not "89/100")
- "forty points max" (not "40 points")
- "$[number]-K" → "two hundred fifty K" or "a quarter million"

---

## DELIVERY NOTES

### Pacing
- **Speak at 3.5 words per second** (conversational pace, not rushed)

  - After "eighty-nine out of one hundred" (1:02)
  - After "VERIFIED" (1:10)
  - Before "Thanks for watching" (1:58)

### Tone
- **Confident, not cocky** - "I built this" (own it!)
- **Conversational, not robotic** - imagine explaining to a colleague
- **Enthusiastic, not manic** - you're proud but professional

### Emphasis Words (Say these slightly louder/clearer)
- "**one-point-four million**"
- "**CMS**" (credibility)
- "**VERIFIED**" (trustworthiness)

### Hand Gestures (if on camera)
- Point to screen when saying "Strategic Intelligence Brief"
- Count on fingers when listing "Pain, Fit, Strategy"
- Open palms when saying "explainable intelligence"

## IF YOU MESS UP

### Common Stumbles & Fixes

**Stumble**: "one-point-four... uh, million"
**Fix**: Just keep going, it's fine

**Stumble**: Forget to hover over tooltip
**Fix**: Hover when you say "explainable" (1:28) instead

**Stumble**: Can't find Export button
**Fix**: Skip it, go straight to closing (1:43)

**Stumble**: Lose your place in script
**Fix**: Jump to closing: "Bottom line, this tool transforms GTM..."

### When to Re-record
- ❌ Re-record if: Can't find the lead, major technical glitch, blank for >3 seconds
- ✅ Keep going if: Small verbal stumble, slight pause, "um" or "uh"

**Remember**: Second take is usually best. Don't re-record more than 3 times or you'll sound robotic.
