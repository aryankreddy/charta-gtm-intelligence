### Raw Context Inputs:

 Automate Chart Review with AI Fully autonomous pre-bill reviews on 100% of your charts – at unparalleled accuracy and costs. What is Charta? Charta's proprietary AI performs a pre-bill review of every chart to capture every revenue and quality opportunity. Revenue Discovery: Increase RVUs per patient by up to 15.2% by performing a pre-bill review of each chart and claim to identify missed coding opportunities — resulting in an average revenue increase of 11%. The Problem Compliance gaps hide billable revenue Undercoded, Compliant Revenue Providers under-bill by an average of 11% of RVUs per patient, from lower-paying E/M MDM levels and missed codable services already supported by documentation. Illustration of a hand holding a star Illustration of a hand holding a star Missed Billable Services Providers often fail to perform, document, or bill reimbursable add-on services, such as preventative screenings or chronic care management - a payer-funded revenue opportunity. Illustration of a hand holding a star Preventable Denials Up to 70% of denials can be prevented by addressing documentation gaps and understanding payer rules like medical necessity and proper primary diagnoses. The Solution AI Chart Review for Revenue Discovery Illustration of a hand holding a star Capture every billable service Charta’s AI reviews 100% of charts pre-bill, ensuring that all documented services are coded correctly and billed at the appropriate level, increasing per-visit revenue. Illustration of a hand holding a security shield Unlock new revenue streams Charta identifies patients eligible for reimbursable add-on services and validates documentation against CMS/payer rules to support the highest defensible level for maximum reimbursement. Illustration of a hand pressing a button Automate revenue discovery Charta replaces limited manual audits with continuous, automated chart review, eliminating conservative underbilling and capturing missed revenue across the organization. How Charta Health Works Step 1 Customize your Charta AI environment Define your clinical and billing audit criteria with your Charta AI Engineer, who will train the AI model to be customized to your organizational needs. Your dedicated AI Engineer will regularly train your environment, keeping a close eye on commonly missed billable services and undercoding trends. Step 2 Conduct pre-bill reviews on 100% of your charts Charta will pull records directly from your EHR, and review 100% of the charts, progress notes, and any other documentation in real-time. This pre-bill review will not only show you missed coding opportunities, but also automate corrective coding to build a systematic way of capturing missed revenue. Step 3 Automate corrections and generate claims After the chart review is complete, you can choose to send corrections directly back to the EMR to automatically update the charts or flag charts for manual approval by a billing or RCM lead. At this point, we can also generate a claim file and push the 837 to the clearinghouse. Charta can also compile comprehensive, recurring reports on missed revenue and coding trends to gain insight into systemic issues–creating a continuous feedback loop that improves coding accuracy, compliance, and overall revenue capture across the organization. 11% Our customers achieve revenue increases of an average of 11%, with increases as high as 15.2%, measured by RVUs per patient. *Measured based on RVUs per patient over a random 90-day sample Outpatient Coding: The Problem Inaccurate coding blocks full reimbursement Lost Revenue from Undercoding Providers leave money on the table when services are under-documented or mis-billed at lower levels. Missed add-on codes can compound, creating systemic revenue leakage. Illustration of a hand holding a star Illustration of a hand holding a star Compliance Risks from Overcoding Over-billing exposes providers to payer audits, clawbacks, fines, or fraud. Failing audits cost money, damages payer relationships, and may trigger more frequent audits in the future. Illustration of a hand holding a star Operational Inefficiencies across the Organization Manual reviews are time consuming, and most organizations only review 5-10% of charts. Denials create more work for billing teams, slowing down revenue cycles.

Charta Series A Article: Charta Health Raises $22M Series A to Rebuild the Backbone of Healthcare Operations with AI Today, we’re proud to announce that Charta Health has raised a $22M Series A led by Bain Capital Ventures, with participation from Madrona, SV Angel, Refract Ventures, and South Park Commons – bringing our total funding to over $30M. Charta is an AI-powered platform built to fix one of the most costly and time-consuming problems in healthcare: manual chart reviews. Every day, healthcare provider organizations spend thousands of hours reviewing clinical documentation, checking for compliance, and processing billing manually — often with limited resources and outdated systems. With Charta, organizations can scale without adding headcount. Our platform augments and replaces manual chart reviews to increase revenue integrity, improve patient care quality, and dramatically reduce administrative overhead. Why now? We didn’t set out to raise another round this quickly - our last one closed just under five months ago. But sometimes the market speaks louder than your timeline. The strain on healthcare operations is real - and growing. From physician practices to hospitals to home health agencies, clinical and billing teams are being asked to do more with less. Hiring is difficult, compliance risk is high, and administrative burdens are piling up. AI is no longer a future solution. It’s what these teams need right now - to automate the unscalable, reduce error rates, and stay compliant under pressure. That’s why we raised this Series A - to meet the demand head-on and build the kind of infrastructure healthcare has needed for decades: intelligent, scalable, and built for the complexity of today’s system. Why Charta Health? Charta Health was founded by engineers who built the AI infrastructure behind some of the world’s leading tech companies, including Rockset (OpenAI’s first ever product acquisition), Google, Salesforce, and more. Long before AI became mainstream, our team was developing the distributed systems and applied machine learning frameworks that now power entire industries. But great infrastructure isn’t enough on its own - especially in healthcare. That’s why we’ve built Charta alongside seasoned healthcare operators: executives who’ve founded, led and scaled organizations across payer and provider systems, including Carbon Health, Optum, and SCAN Health Plan. The result is a platform grounded in both deep technical rigor and real-world healthcare expertise. Charta tackles a costly gap in healthcare operations: the fragmented, manual processes that link clinical documentation to accurate billing. Billing, coding, and compliance processes remain outdated, fragmented, and increasingly costly under the weight of regulatory scrutiny and staffing pressure. By leveraging advanced AI algorithms, Charta automates the traditionally manual process of chart review, improving patient care quality, reducing administrative overhead, and optimizing financial performance. Core features include: AI-Powered Documentation Review From progress notes to face-to-face assessments to visit logs, Charta’s proprietary engine reviews and validates documentation in real time - reducing manual burden and surfacing gaps before they become denials. Ensuring Patient Care Quality at Scale Every chart is reviewed automatically against client-specific clinical documentation requirements. Our platform flags issues before submission - ensuring clinical care standards, identifying missed diagnoses, and keeping teams aligned with payer documentation policies. 100% Chart Coverage, No Added Headcount With 10.6x the chart coverage per FTE and a 72% improvement in accuracy over internal teams, Charta helps organizations scale their QA and compliance functions without hiring additional staff or compromising on quality. Bonus: Real Financial Impact While many clients first adopt Charta for compliance, they often discover significant financial upside: up to 15.2% RVU improvement per chart in organizations with physician-led coding. As our CEO, Justin Liu, notes: ‍“Charts are the lifeblood of any healthcare organization. If you’re not reviewing all of them, you’re leaving money on the table and taking on avoidable risk.” Charta isn’t about incremental gains. It’s about building the infrastructure healthcare has long needed - fully automated, deeply integrated, and ready to scale. Customer Thesis We believe the true value of AI in healthcare isn’t just how many tasks it automates - it’s what it enables people to do with the time, clarity, and control it unlocks. For KidsCare Home Health, a leading provider of pediatric home health services across multiple states, that meant eliminating the operational and compliance friction that stood between clinical managers and quality care. As the organization scaled, so did the complexity of its workflows. Clinical managers were buried in documentation review, visit note processing, and manual oversight across dozens of therapists - all while navigating rising compliance demands and tight resources. By adopting Charta, KidsCare saw immediate, measurable gains in operational efficiency and compliance oversight: 25%+ reduction in clinical management workflow duties across 19 clinical managers An estimated 10,000 hours saved annually, enabling time to be reallocated toward hiring, mentorship, and patient care Expanded therapist oversight without increasing headcount, improving visibility and accountability across the board “Charta has changed the entire work capabilities of our clinical management team. Nobody wants to sit in an office and do workflow. That’s not why people become therapists." — Micki Roget, COO, KidsCare Home Health This is the kind of transformation we’re building Charta to deliver: fewer bottlenecks, more bandwidth, and a system that supports - those at the front lines of care. Investor Thesis Charta sits at the center of a rare alignment: a massive, fragmented market; a mature buyer mindset; strong policy tailwinds; and the technical infrastructure to build what healthcare actually needs. “Charta’s team combines world-class AI capabilities with a precise understanding of healthcare’s most complex operational bottlenecks. The healthcare industry is finally at an inflection point where infrastructure, regulation, and provider demand are aligned for scaled AI adoption. Charta is stepping in at exactly the right time - with the right architecture, and the right team to execute.” — Aaref Hilaly, Partner, Bain Capital Ventures For decades, healthcare operations have lagged behind clinical innovation. The revenue cycle - arguably the financial backbone of the healthcare system - remains manual, fragmented, and error-prone. Despite years of outsourced labor and legacy tools, the problems haven’t been solved - they’ve multiplied. What’s different now is timing. Health systems are facing unprecedented margin pressure, workforce shortages, and growing regulatory scrutiny. At the same time, there's broad consensus that AI is not just viable - it’s urgently needed. Decision-makers are ready to buy. Infrastructure that can deliver step-change improvements, not just incremental gains, is finally in reach. Today, Charta partners with leading healthcare organizations like Eventus WholeHealth, Family Care Center, and Preventive Measures — organizations that have chosen to scale with Charta because of our rapid product development, clinical depth, and measurable financial impact. What’s Next? This raise marks a new chapter for Charta. It’s not just an injection of capital - it’s a catalyst to accelerate our mission: enabling providers to focus on patient care. Backed by strong market pull, a focused product foundation, and a world-class team, we’re scaling with both discipline and momentum. We’re actively hiring across engineering, product, and go-to-market roles. If you're an engineer excited to work on deeply technical problems that have real-world impact - and want to help build the infrastructure healthcare should have had years ago - we’d love to talk. This is a rare opportunity to solve hard problems in a space that truly matters. Click here to check our open roles. And if you’re a healthcare operator facing the kinds of challenges we’ve outlined - missed coding opportunities, audit risk, or administrative strain from manual chart review - we want to hear from you. Whether you lead a physician practice, hospital system, or a home health agency, Charta helps improve documentation quality, increase billing accuracy, and strengthen compliance — all while reducing administrative burden and improving patient care. We’re building for scale - but always with clinicians and revenue cycle leaders at the center. Let’s get to work.

Healthcare has officially shed its "digital laggard" title. The AI revolution is in full swing, and the numbers are stunning: $1.4B in spending, 75% coming from providers, and buying cycles dropping from 18 months to under 6. Menlo Ventures released their State of AI in Healthcare this week, and findings line up perfectly with the incredible shift we’re seeing in the market: 1/ Spending is massive, and provider-driven Healthcare AI investment has topped $1.4B in 2025, with providers driving 75% of the total spend. 2/ The ROI categories are clear The two largest AI categories are ambient documentation (ex: Abridge, Ambience Healthcare) at $600M and coding/billing automation (ex: Charta Health, Optum) at $450M. 3/ The priority is in operations When purchasing AI, providers prioritize: - Tech maturity: Solutions that are production-ready and perform reliably at scale. - Risk level: Non-patient-facing tools (e.g. RCM) are adopted quicker. - Quick value: Solutions that deliver rapid ROI and instill organizational confidence. 4/ Speed is the new normal The buying cycles for AI solutions have compressed dramatically, falling from 12-18 months to under 6 months. 5/ Startups dominate 85% of all healthcare AI spend is flowing through startups because of our ability to move quickly, design natively for AI, and deliver measurable ROI. The biggest takeaway for us? Menlo Ventures believes that 80% of the market is untapped, waiting for newcomers like Charta Health to fully solve for back-office automation with a clear path to fast returns. We're built for this. We're proving this model every day for our customers. What surprised you most about this $1.4B market shift? 41% of providers now see more than 10% of their claims denied. Two years ago, it was just 30%. The driver is clear: AI is fundamentally changing how claims get processed. Payers have quietly deployed AI across their claims processing workflows. These systems don't miss patterns. They analyze billing trends, flag documentation gaps, and cross-reference policy compliance across millions of claims with growing consistency. The result? Denial rates are climbing—not because clinical care has changed, but because the technology reviewing claims has evolved. Here's what struck me during a conversation with a CFO last week: she described feeling like the rules of the game had changed overnight. Her team was doing the same work they'd always done, but suddenly facing denials they'd never seen before. The documentation that may have passed six months ago was now coming back flagged for incompleteness. This is the new reality of healthcare finance. But here's where the story gets interesting. The same AI technology that's identifying issues on the payer side can work just as effectively for providers—before claims ever leave the building. Imagine catching documentation gaps while the patient is still in your system. Imagine validating billing codes against the latest policy updates in real-time. Imagine reducing denials not by appealing more, but by submitting cleaner claims from the start. All this work, done at the pre-bill stage. This isn't about fighting fire with fire. It's about recognizing that we're now operating in an AI-enabled ecosystem, and the organizations that adapt will have a fundamental operational advantage. The tools exist. The technology works. What I'm seeing is a growing divide between healthcare organizations that are moving quickly to integrate AI into their workflows and those that are still processing this shift. AI adoption isn't optional anymore. It's the new baseline for operational and financial competence in healthcare. No matter where my team at Charta Health and I went this year like HLTH USA, RISE, National Association of ACOs, or Becker's Healthcare Behavioral Health Summit, healthcare execs kept coming back to the same consistent conversations. Here they are: ✅ If you're selling to providers, payers, or health systems, you have to be EMR-agnostic. No one wants to rip out workflows or retrain staff. The expectation is simple: your solution should work with what’s already in place, not add friction. Lightweight integration and a clear understanding of how it fits into the existing tech stack are non-negotiables. ✅ Revenue leakage is becoming a C-suite concern. What was once considered a back-office inefficiency is increasingly seen as a strategic risk. As margins tighten, missed revenue from underbilling and limited claims review is becoming harder for leadership to overlook. ✅ Too many new AI tools, not enough differentiation. With the influx of AI-first healthtech companies, numerous leaders express confusion: everything sounds the same, every demo promises “AI workflow optimization,” and very few explain how they’re actually different or present a clear value proposition. ✅ Point solutions are being pushed aside. Providers and payers are tired of stitching together a dozen tools to solve one problem. They’re asking harder questions about scalability, interoperability, and whether a solution actually addresses the full use case - not just one narrow slice of it. ✅ Operational fatigue is setting the tone. Between burnout, staffing shortages, and competing priorities, teams are stretched thin. Tools that add complexity - even subtly - are getting passed over. What healthcare leaders are looking for right now is clarity, simplicity, and tools that offer immediate, practical support within their day-to-day reality. Bain Capital Ventures (Their Investor) Article: Charting a New Era: How Charta Health is Transforming Medical Chart Review 22 Jul 2025 | 5 mins After OpenAI acquired their last startup, Charta’s founders became certified medical coders to build a category-defining compliance automation platform. Founder Stories Early Aaref Hilaly Alysaa Co “Medical coder” is not usually high on the list of career choices for two talented engineers with experience at a leading startup that OpenAI acquired. But that's what Justin Liu and Scott Morris did in 2023, as they thought about how best to apply AI to the most significant problems in healthcare. That early decision, combined with their intellect and intensity, led to the creation of what became Charta Health. It’s also what first drew us to them when we met at pre-seed in 2023. Since then, Charta has evolved into the leading compliance automation platform for provider groups. The starting point is a transformational AI application in chart review. Whereas traditionally only 1% of charts could be reviewed post billing, with Charta 100% of charts are reviewed pre-billing. That delivers an 11% revenue uplift and an 11:1 ROI by improving revenue integrity, enhancing patient care, and reducing audit and compliance costs. Charta is stepping in when providers need it most. With nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts looming over the next decade, and federal and state funding reductions tightening margins, stricter eligibility rules and documentation requirements are adding pressure on provider groups. Providers are focused on streamlining operations and improving coding and revenue processes, and we believe Charta is built to meet that need. Meet the Founder: Justin Liu is a Technical CEO with Product Vision & GTM Chops Applying Technical Expertise to Product Building Justin and Scott have worked together since 2020, when Scott teamed up with Justin as engineering and product counterparts at Rockset (acquired by OpenAI). In addition to being colleagues-turned-co-founders, they each dedicated a year to securing the Certified Professional Coder credential, which enables them to build for medical use cases with regulatory cover and garner healthcare field endorsement. Upon first meeting Justin and Scott, we were immediately impressed by both their scrappy GTM execution and and the strong latent demand for what they were building. By simply cold outbounding hundreds of practices over a few weeks, they secured several six-figure contracts. Customers consistently rave about their pace of product development. One large primary care group told us, “During our first meeting, we shared our struggle with chart review and audit. By the second meeting, Justin and Scott had already built a prototype addressing our issues — something I didn’t know was possible in six days.” Charting a Better Path AI has transformed the way we think about work and expands our capacity to accomplish more. Whether it’s managing thousands of customer support tickets, combing through vast legal databases or designing customized learning modules for students, AI is breaking barriers across industries and achieving tasks that were once out of reach. These same constraints are amplified in healthcare, with increased administrative burden on providers, ever-changing payer requirements and rising labor costs. For context, a 2024 study shared by the American Hospital Association cites admin costs as more than 40 percent of total hospital costs incurred in delivering care to patients. Providers, already stretched thin after back-to-back patient visits, code visits at the end of a busy day, relying on imperfect recall of a patient’s full medical history. Before Charta, audit teams reviewed coded charts to catch errors. However, human auditors can only review 1% of charts, typically months after the fact. As a result, 99% of errors go unnoticed—and even when flagged, meaningful corrections are rarely made. Building these audit teams also requires months of training. Charta changes this dynamic entirely by leveraging AI to ingest 100% of charts in real time, reviewing visit notes, labs, and medical history against coding and audit protocols specific to each practice. This approach identifies missed revenue opportunities from incorrect coding, ensures compliance with payer rules, prevents costly clawbacks, and significantly reduces administrative burden on audit teams. Audit and compliance are just the tip of the iceberg. Charta can redefine how charting is done, bringing time and clarity back to providers, and become a trust layer between the entire healthcare ecosystem of patients, providers and payers. AI will shape the future of healthcare across tech stacks, billing cycles and administrative operations. We’re thrilled to partner with Charta who is leading the change. Fierce Healthcare Article: Charta Health built an artificial-intelligence-powered platform to optimize medical billing and coding. The three-year-old startup raised $22 million in series A funding to propel its growth. Bain Capital Ventures led the series A, with Madrona, SV Angel, Refract Ventures and South Park Commons also backing Charta's funding round. The company has raised $30 million this year alone, including an $8.1 million seed round in March, also led by Bain Capital Ventures. Charta plans to use the funding to scale product development, grow its engineering and go-to-market teams and complete more enterprise integrations with leading providers and payers nationwide, executives said. Charta uses AI to automate manual patient chart review, a process that links clinical documentation to accurate coding and billing. While chart review is necessary to meet clinical quality and payer and billing requirements, it's historically a costly and time-consuming process. The startup works with providers to perform AI-enabled reviews of medical charts before they are submitted to identify missed coding opportunities, prevent claim denials and ensure compliance with billing standards. Healthcare organizations across 43 states use Charta's software to increase revenue and patient care quality while reducing administrative burden. On average, customers report up to a 15.2% increase in relative value units per patient, resulting in an 11% increase in revenue, according to the company. "We're working with primary care clinics that are famously are operating on half-point, one-point margins. We single-handedly turn clinics profitable with the technology that we're using by completely changing their business," Justin Liu, CEO and co-founder, asserts. The company's technology can surface revenue opportunities and coding mistakes to help cut down on claims denials. The platform audits 100% of pre-bill charts against client-specific billing and clinical guidelines. The technology also doesn't increase head count, executives said. With 10.6x the chart coverage per FTE and a 72% improvement in accuracy over internal teams, Charta helps organizations scale their quality assurance and compliance functions without hiring additional staff or compromising on quality, executives claim. Related Startup Brellium picks up $16.7M to scale up AI for medical chart reviews Charta Health was founded by Liu and Scott Morris, engineers who launched startup Rockset, which was acquired by OpenAI a year ago to enhance its data processing, analytics and retrieval capabilities. "We had a front-row seat to see the power of AI," Liu said in an interview with Fierce Healthcare. Long before AI became mainstream, Liu and Morris' team was developing the distributed systems and applied machine learning frameworks that now power entire industries, the executives said in a blog post. The duo brought that expertise in AI infrastructure to Charta. "We saw that it was a notoriously broken industry—there's so much legacy technology, fragmented data, a ton of overhead and administrative burden, and it's a highly inefficient industry," he said. The Charta team sees opportunities to use AI for back-office operations that result in fewer bottlenecks, more bandwidth and a system that supports those at the front lines of care, executives said. Liu and Morris spent a year learning more about the industry, interviewing more than 100 healthcare leaders to understand revenue cycle pain points, and even earned their Certified Professional Coder credentials. The executives also now require certain teams within the company, particularly engineering and go-to-market roles, to get certified in medical coding as well. "Anytime we have engineers using AI to solve any problem in healthcare, we require them to get certified to do that work as humans first," Liu said. "When you're talking with billers and coders on the other side, you really need to understand how their world works and speak the same language as them. Just because we're using AI to do it doesn't mean we get to shortcut any of those steps." Related Intermountain makes strategic investment in Layer Health to improve chart review Charta's executive team includes executives who have founded, led and scaled organizations across payer and provider systems, including Carbon Health, Optum and SCAN Health Plan. Carbon Health co-founder Caesar Djavaherian, M.D., joined the company as chief medical officer. Charta is tackling a big, hairy problem in healthcare. The U.S. healthcare system loses more than $300 billion annually due to billing errors, undercoding and preventable claim denials. There are also several industry tailwinds propelling the need for AI-enabled technologies in healthcare operations. Health systems are facing unprecedented margin pressure, workforce shortages and growing regulatory scrutiny. There are a number of companies trying to tackle this challenge with AI, including Brellium, which raised $16.7 million in April; Dyania Health, which picked up $10 million last year; and Layer Health, which is building a core platform for AI chart review. Charta currently works with 100 healthcare organizations including Eventus WholeHealth, Family Care Center and Preventive Measures. The company's automated chart review technology is beneficial for medical specialties with a high volume of patients and low reimbursement such as primary care, urgent care and behavioral health as AI can more efficiently review hundreds of patient charts, Liu said. Home health providers also can benefit from Charta's technology as the billing process is complex and there's a large amount of documentation, he noted. One customer, KidsCare Home Health, a provider of pediatric home health services across multiple states, reports it saw "immediate, measurable gains in operational efficiency and compliance oversight" by adopting Charta, according to the company's blog post. The company reports a 25%-plus reduction in clinical management workflow duties across 19 clinical managers, an estimated 10,000 hours saved annually and expanded therapist oversight without increasing head count. “Charta Health has completely changed the working capabilities of our clinical management team, which is huge,” Micki Roget, chief operating officer of KidsCare Home Health, said in a statement. “Nobody becomes a therapist to sit in an office doing workflow. Charta gives that time back.”
