# Charta GTM Intelligence Tool - Loom Demo Script
**Duration: 60-90 seconds**

---

## OPENING: THE DATA (0:00 - 0:15)
*[Screen: Dashboard landing page showing top 2,500 leads]*

**"Hi, I'm [Your Name]. I built this GTM Intelligence Tool to solve a massive problem: how do you find the best healthcare leads when there are millions of potential customers?**

**This system ingests data from CMS - the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services:**
- **1.4 million organizations scored nationwide**
- **Medicare claims data** - actual revenue, visit volumes, E&M coding patterns
- **MIPS quality scores** - performance benchmarks
- **HPSA/MUA designations** - underserved area indicators
- **NPPES provider data** - contact info, specialties, locations

**The result? A ranked database of the top 2,500 organizations with the highest revenue opportunity for Charta's AI chart review solution."**

---

## SCORING METHODOLOGY (0:15 - 0:30)
*[Hover over Info icon next to "Tier 1 Leads" to show tier breakdown]*

**"Every organization gets an ICP score from 0-100 based on three components:**

*[Point to each as you mention it]*

**1. Pain (40 points max)** - Revenue leakage from E&M undercoding, measured via actual Medicare claims data comparing their coding patterns to national benchmarks.

**2. Strategic Fit (30 points max)** - Alignment with our proven segments like FQHCs and Behavioral Health, plus quality indicators like MIPS and HPSA status.

**3. Strategic Value (30 points max)** - Deal size potential based on patient volume and revenue scale.

**Organizations are tiered into:**
- **Tier 1 (70+)**: [X] high-priority leads - immediate sales focus
- **Tier 2 (50-69)**: Qualified leads worth nurturing
- **Tier 3 (<50)**: Low-priority, monitoring only

## MULTI-TRACK INTELLIGENCE (0:30 - 0:45)
*[Show Track filter: Ambulatory vs Behavioral]*

**"The system is smart enough to apply different scoring logic for different practice types."**

*[Click Behavioral filter]*

**"Behavioral Health organizations are scored on therapy complexity and audit risk patterns - totally different metrics than Ambulatory practices.**

*[Click back to Ambulatory, then show Segment filter]*

**"And I can instantly slice by segment - FQHCs, Hospitals, Urgent Care, Primary Care, Behavioral Health - or filter to only VERIFIED opportunities where revenue estimates come from actual claims data, not projections."**

---

## LEAD DEEP DIVE (0:45 - 1:15)
*[Click Tier 1 filter, then FQHC segment, then click on top lead like "Grace Health, Inc."]*

**"Let's look at a real example: Grace Health - scored 89 out of 100.**

*[Point to Strategic Brief at top of drawer]*

**The Strategic Intelligence Brief instantly tells me:**
- **Estimated revenue lift: $[XXX]K** - and notice it says VERIFIED, meaning this is calculated from their actual Medicare claims
- **Why they have pain**: High Medicare volume with undercoding patterns on E&M visits
- **Why they fit**: FQHC designation, our proven high-value segment with strong MIPS scores and HPSA designation
- **Why they're strategic**: Large patient volume means multi-million dollar annual contract potential

*[Scroll to Score Breakdown section]*

**The score is fully explainable - breakdown shows:**
- **Pain: [X]/40 points** - measured via undercoding ratio from CMS data
- **Fit: [X]/30 points** - FQHC bonus, MIPS performance, HPSA/MUA indicators
- **Strategy: [X]/30 points** - revenue and volume scale

*[Hover over Pain bar to show tooltip]*
**Hover over any score to see the exact reasoning - like 'High Medicare volume with undercoding ratio of [X]%' - this is all data-driven, not guesswork."**

---

## DATABASE FEATURES (1:15 - 1:25)
*[Scroll down to show contact info, network details, key metrics]*

**"The database includes everything you need:**
- **Contact info**: Phone, address, NPI
- **Network details**: Health systems, affiliations
- **Key metrics**: Revenue, volume, MIPS scores, undercoding ratios
- **Buying signals**: Top pain drivers like 'Revenue Leakage', 'High Medicare Volume', 'FQHC - Core ICP'

*[Click Export button]*
**And I can export directly to HubSpot or CSV for immediate sales follow-up."**

---

## CLOSING: THE IMPACT (1:25 - 1:30)
*[Navigate back to main table showing filtered Tier 1 list]*

**"Bottom line: this tool transforms GTM from spray-and-pray to surgical precision.**

**Instead of manually researching thousands of clinics, sales now has:**
- **[X] Tier 1 leads** with verified revenue opportunities
- **Data-driven prioritization** based on real CMS claims data
- **Explainable intelligence** - every score, every signal, fully transparent
- **Multi-million dollar pipeline** ready for immediate outreach

**Thanks for watching!"**

## ALTERNATIVE SCRIPT: DATA-FIRST APPROACH (Full 90 seconds)

If you want to lead with the data sources more heavily:

### OPENING: THE DATA CHALLENGE (0:00 - 0:20)

**"Hi, I'm [Your Name]. Healthcare GTM has a massive problem: millions of potential customers, but who should you call first?**

**I built this tool to answer that question using real government data from CMS:**

*[Quick cuts showing different parts of dashboard as you mention each]*

**Here's what went into this:**
- **NPPES Provider Database**: 1.4M organizations, contact info, specialties
- **Medicare Claims Data**: Actual revenue, visit volumes, E&M coding patterns
- **MIPS Quality Program**: Performance scores for 200K+ providers
- **HPSA/MUA Designations**: Underserved area indicators from HRSA
- **UDS Reporting**: Patient volume data for 1,400+ FQHCs

**I unified all of this into a single intelligence platform that scores every organization on their fit for Charta's AI chart review solution.**

**The result? 1.4 million organizations ranked, top 2,500 surfaced, all searchable and filterable."**

## RECOMMENDED LEADS TO SHOWCASE

**Best Demo Lead Criteria:**
1. **Tier 1 (score 70+)** - shows quality
2. **FQHC segment** - easiest to explain, proven segment
3. **VERIFIED lift status** - data credibility
4. **$200K+ opportunity** - impressive number
5. **Clear pain signals** - High Medicare Volume, Revenue Leakage, etc.

**Top FQHC Candidates** (check your actual data):
- Grace Health, Inc.
- Family Health Centers of San Diego
- Chase Brexton Health Care
- Callen-Lorde Community Health Center

**Why FQHC over other segments:**
- Universally understood mission (underserved populations)
- "Revenue leakage" pain point is clear
- FQHC = Charta's proven high-value segment
- Typically larger $ opportunities

## TALKING POINTS: DATA SOURCES

If asked "where does this data come from?":

**"All data comes from official CMS and HRSA government databases:**

- **Revenue & volume**: Medicare claims data from CMS
- **Coding patterns**: E&M visit distributions from Part B claims
- **Quality scores**: MIPS performance data (public dataset)
- **Contact info**: NPPES provider database
- **Designations**: HPSA/MUA from HRSA, FQHC from UDS reporting

**Nothing is scraped or estimated - this is all official government reporting data that healthcare organizations are required to submit. The only 'projection' is for organizations with incomplete data, which we flag as 'PROJECTED' rather than 'VERIFIED'."**

## FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE RECORDING

### Technical Prep
- [ ] Close all browser tabs except demo
- [ ] Set browser zoom to 100%
- [ ] Clear browser notifications
- [ ] Check internet connection (no lag during demo)
- [ ] Have Vercel production URL ready (not localhost)

### Content Prep
- [ ] Know your Tier 1 count (get exact number from dashboard)
- [ ] Identify your showcase lead (top FQHC with verified data)
- [ ] Note the exact numbers you'll cite (revenue lift, score, etc.)
- [ ] Rehearse once (should be 80-85 seconds)
- [ ] Practice the hover moments (tier tooltip, score breakdown tooltip)

### Delivery Prep
- [ ] Test audio (clear voice, no background noise)
- [ ] Smile when you talk (comes through in voice energy)
- [ ] Speak with confidence - "I built this" not "we tried to build"
- [ ] Use active language - "surfaces", "arms sales with", "transforms"
- [ ] Don't apologize or caveat - the work is impressive!

### Recording Strategy
- **First take**: Do a full run-through even if you mess up - helps with timing
- **Second take**: Usually your best - you're warmed up but still fresh
- **Third take**: Only if needed - avoid over-rehearsing (sounds robotic)
